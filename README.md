Hi

I have my parents and two younger brother.
I have graduated from Yangon Computer University, specializing in Computer Science.
I have started studying Japanese since I have been in university days.
I have arrived  Japan before 5 years ago.
As an IT employee, I had about 1 year of educational experience, 2 years as a programmer, and about 4 years as an Oracle database engineer.
I usually spend my free time reading books, listening to music, watching movies, and studying foreign languages.
